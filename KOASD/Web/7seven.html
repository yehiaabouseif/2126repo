            Soon Stephen tells his wife Anna. But she is unclear. She’s annoyingly more interested in the back story. Martin’s father’s death than helping Stephen solve this logic puzzle. She wants to know if he’d been drinking. She wants to know his relationship to Martin, the mother… etc. Gah! I mean, that’s irrelevant! Right? But soon the movie barrels forward and we find ourselves with Martin, held hostage, by Stephen, in the basement. He’s been shot. And beaten. But still the kids illnesses are progressing. So when Anna let’s Martin go, Stephen and Anna have a choice to make. Should they kill one child to save the other?

            And sure enough, that’s what Stephen does. In a game Russian Roulette of the worst kind… Stephen shoots Bob, and he dies. Chosen randomly… the gods have spoken. And just like that, Kim gets better, and the family tries to move on. Right? The what of the movie makes sense right? It’s just the – WHAT THE HECK – of the movie that doesn’t make any sense at all. So let’s away, shall we, to the next section of our discussion around the explanation of what happened in The Killing of a Sacred Deer?
