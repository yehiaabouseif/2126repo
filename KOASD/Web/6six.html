            The story itself is simple enough. A doctor, Dr. Stephen Murphy, has had an accident. During heart surgery he has killed a patient on his table. Murphy may have had a drink or two before the procedure, but it definitely was an accident. Only problem? This now dead patient has a son, Martin, and a widow that he has now left bereaved (left bereft? No idea.)

        <div class="content col col-5 meta-6" style="font-size:11px; color:#A59CA0; margin-top: 600px;">
                
            Anyway, now, as far as troubling coincidences go, Martin, happens to be a god. Ok, set the god thing aside for now… maybe not a god, but rather, someone with interesting super powers. And in exchange for killing his father, Martin expects Dr. Murphy to make amends. And here are his terms: the doctor can either kill one of his children, or, watch as everyone in his family gets paralysis, stops eating, and then begins bleeding out the eyes… and finally dies.

            Is this hyperbole? The ravings of a lost, and mourning soul? Well, when Bob collapses, and cannot walk… we begin to wonder if this wasn’t the ravings of a lunatic. And when Kim collapses as well? Well, now we know we are fullon walking into the world of the Twilight Zone. (Speaking of which, I totally remember an episode of the Twilight Zone that reminds me of this movie – the one entitled “It’s A Good Life”, wherein there is a boy that controls everyone in this town, and sends them “Out into the corn” if they frustrate or anger him. But in this episode of the Twilight Zone, the boy’s name is Martin, and instead of sending them out into the corn, he kills them.)
